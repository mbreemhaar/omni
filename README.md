# Omni - A Discord bot that can do all the things!
OmniBot is a Discord bot that is still in early development. However, it will soon be the bot that can do everything you want it to do!

## Add Omni to your own Discord server
Click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=811235136699891764&permissions=8&scope=bot) to invite Omni to your own Discord server and use !help to view a list of all available commands.

## Run your own bot server
To run your own version of Omni, follow the instructions below. To do so, first make your own bot account on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/). Instructions for doing this are available [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html).

The easiest way to get Omni running on your server is by using Docker.

1. Download Docker from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/) and install it on your system.
2. Use ```docker run mbreemhaar/omni:latest your-bot-token``` to spin up a Docker container.

If you followed all steps on the Discord Developer Portal correctly, you should now see your bot come online in your Discord server.
